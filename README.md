# Flashcard Project
The "Flashcards" repository on GitHub is a web application built using React that allows users to create, edit, and study virtual flashcards.

Within the repository, the "create-new-card" file is a component of the application that allows users to create new flashcards. When a user clicks on the "Create Card" button, the "create-new-card" component is rendered.

The component contains a form with input fields for the front and back of the flashcard. The input fields are wrapped in labels and styled with CSS. The component also contains a button labeled "Create" that, when clicked, submits the form and creates a new flashcard with the information provided by the user.

The component uses React hooks to manage the state of the input fields and the submission of the form. The state is updated as the user types in the input fields, and the "onChange" event handler ensures that the state is updated with each keystroke. The "onSubmit" event handler is triggered when the user clicks the "Create" button, and it creates a new flashcard with the state data.

Overall, the "create-new-card" file is an essential part of the "Flashcards" application, allowing users to easily create new virtual flashcards to study.
